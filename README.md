# A GraphQL proxy that uses graphql-js

MVP for a GraphQL proxy. Initially nothing more than a GraphQL server.

This GraphQL proxy is built on
* express
* graphql-js
* graphql-shorthand-parser


## How to use:

Apollo-proxy takes two inputs:
1. A GraphQL schema in shorthand format
1. One or more javascript code files that define resolve functions

An example of a valid GraphQL shorthand input:
```
type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  genre: Genre
  author: Author
}

interface Person {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String
  middleName: String
}

type Author: Person {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String
  middleName: String
  booksPublished: [Book]
}

enum Genre {
  FICTION
  NONFICTION
}

type RootQuery {
  author(id: ID!): Author,
  book(title: String!): Book
}

type RootMutation {
  addBook(title: String!, genre: Genre!, author_id: ID): Book
}
```

The corresponding file that defines how fields are resolved. If a field does not
have a resolve function, it is assumed to be the standard resolve function.
```
import DB from "DB.js";

export const {
  Book: {
    _resolve: id => DB.Books.get(id), // this function gets called as Book
    author: (book, _, _) => Author(book.author_id),
    // fields without resolve function just return book.<fieldName>
  },

  Author: {
    _resolve: id => DB.Authors.get(id),
    booksPublished: (author, _, _) => DB.Books.list( {author_id: author.id}),
  },

  RootQuery: {
    author: (_, { id }, _) => Author(id),
    book: (_, { title }, _) => DB.Books.getByTitle(title),
  },

  RootMutation: {
    addBook: (_, { title, genre, author_id }, _) => {
      return DB.createBook( {title: title, genre: genre, author_id: author_id});
    },
  },
}
```
